## **Core Lore Recap**

### **The Premise**

In *“I O 5-6: The Numbing”*, the world is teetering on the edge of collapse, plagued by emotional turmoil and existential dread. A shadowy entity has developed a product called **“I O 5-6”**, a drug-like substance designed to numb people’s emotions and intellect, marketed as the ultimate escape from life’s hardships. Advertisements promise to make users “void of all intellect” and free from “those annoying things of the past that we call ‘emotions.’” The product’s effects are profound: it strips away consciousness, leaving behind hollow shells of humanity, devoid of feeling, thought, or will.

The game is deeply tied to the album *IO* by ten56, which explores themes of duality. Players embody an agent of the numbing agenda, tasked with balancing two opposing forces:

- **Numbing the Population (Flipping Them “Off”):** Spread “I O 5-6” to dull the masses, silencing their emotions and intellect.
- **Preserving Emotional Essence (Keeping Them “On”):** Maintain enough un-numbed individuals to harvest **Emotional Essence**, a vital resource used to fuel the numbing campaign and sustain the system’s operations.

The ultimate goal? Numb **99.9% of the population**, after which the player can choose to “take the last dose” and terminate consciousness entirely, plunging the world into a void of silence and emptiness—a dark reflection of the album’s themes.

## **Expanded Lore**

### **Origin of “I O 5-6”**

The product “I O 5-6” was created by **The Void Collective**, a clandestine group of rogue scientists, disillusioned artists, and shadowy industrialists. They discovered a way to manipulate human consciousness through a combination of chemical compounds and subliminal frequencies. These frequencies were embedded in the music of ten56, whose intense, hypnotic sound became the perfect vessel to prepare the masses for numbing. The band’s music subtly conditions listeners to accept the void, making them more susceptible to the effects of “I O 5-6.”

The Collective’s motives are shrouded in mystery. Some believe they seek to “purify” humanity by erasing its chaotic emotions and flawed intellect. Others suspect they harvest Emotional Essence for a darker purpose—perhaps to fuel an otherworldly entity or to transcend human existence entirely. Whatever their goal, the Collective operates in the shadows, using propaganda, subliminal messaging, and coercion to spread their influence.

### **The Numbing Process**

When a person takes “I O 5-6,” they don’t just lose emotions—they undergo a multi-stage transformation that erodes their humanity:

- **Stage 1: Emotional Numbing** – Emotions fade, leaving only cold logic. Individuals feel nothing—no joy, no sorrow, no anger—just emptiness.
- **Stage 2: Intellectual Numbing** – Critical thinking and creativity dissolve. Memories blur, and the ability to solve problems or dream fades, reducing people to automatons.
- **Stage 3: Will Numbing** – The final stage, where even the will to live is extinguished. Individuals become completely passive, existing only as hollow shells, awaiting the void.

Each stage is irreversible, and the process is addictive—once a person starts numbing, they crave more, accelerating their descent into nothingness.

### **Global Impact**

As numbing spreads, the world transforms into a desolate, silent wasteland:

- Cities fall eerily quiet, with streets empty of laughter, argument, or life.
- Economies collapse as numbed individuals lose the drive to work, innovate, or consume.
- Nature begins to reclaim urban landscapes, with vines creeping over silent skyscrapers and wildlife returning to abandoned streets.
- The sky grows dimmer, colors fade, and the air feels heavier, as if the world itself is succumbing to the void.

### **Resistance and Rebellion**

Not everyone accepts the numbing agenda. A faction called **The Awakened** rises to fight back, believing in the sanctity of human consciousness. They view “I O 5-6” as an abomination, a betrayal of what makes us human. The Awakened sabotage production facilities, attempt to “wake” numbed individuals, and spread anti-numbing propaganda. Their efforts create a constant tension between control and chaos, forcing players to confront the consequences of their actions.

## **New Features and Mechanics**

The expanded lore opens the door to new mechanics that deepen the game’s strategic and immersive qualities. Each mechanic is designed to reinforce the themes of duality and the descent into darkness, ensuring players feel the weight of their actions.

-----

### **1. Stages of Numbing**

**Description:** Numbing now occurs in three distinct stages, each with unique effects and challenges. Players must manage the distribution of doses to balance the benefits and drawbacks of each stage.

**Mechanics:**

- **Stage 1 (Emotional Numbing):**
  - Numbed individuals no longer produce Emotional Essence but can still perform basic tasks, such as distributing doses or maintaining facilities.
  - Benefit: Reduces resistance efforts, as emotionally numb individuals are less likely to rebel.
  - Drawback: Loss of essence production from these individuals.
- **Stage 2 (Intellectual Numbing):**
  - Individuals lose critical thinking and creativity but can be assigned to research upgrades at reduced efficiency.
  - Benefit: Provides a small boost to research speed, as numbed individuals follow orders without question.
  - Drawback: Research quality decreases, and errors may occur, leading to setbacks.
- **Stage 3 (Will Numbing):**
  - Individuals become completely passive and can be “recycled” for a small amount of Emotional Essence, but this action increases resistance.
  - Benefit: Provides a desperate source of essence in late-game scenarios.
  - Drawback: Recycling individuals sparks outrage among The Awakened, increasing rebel attacks.

**Progression:**

- Each dose advances a person through the stages (e.g., one dose for Stage 1, two doses for Stage 2, three doses for Stage 3).
- Players must decide how far to push numbing, balancing essence needs with resistance risks.

-----

### **2. Resistance Mechanics**

**Description:** The Awakened are a constant threat, attempting to sabotage the numbing agenda and “wake” numbed individuals. Players must manage resistance efforts to maintain control.

**Mechanics:**

- **Rebel Attacks:**
  - The Awakened periodically attack production facilities, destroying doses, disrupting automation, or stealing essence.
  - Frequency increases as more people are numbed, especially after recycling Stage 3 individuals.
  - Countermeasures:
    - Invest Emotional Essence in security upgrades to reduce attack frequency or damage.
    - Deploy numbed individuals as guards, though Stage 2 or 3 guards are less effective.
- **Propaganda Wars:**
  - Players can spend essence on propaganda campaigns to:
    - Reduce resistance strength by convincing rebels to give up or defect.
    - Convert rebels back to the numbed population, adding them to the player’s workforce.
    - Temporarily boost dose production or distribution efficiency by rallying numbed individuals.
  - Propaganda campaigns have diminishing returns, requiring more essence over time.
- **Waking Efforts:**
  - Rebels attempt to “wake” numbed individuals, reverting them to un-numbed status and reducing the numbed population.
  - Players must allocate resources to:
    - Prevent waking by reinforcing numbing facilities or deploying guards.
    - Reverse waking by re-numbing individuals, though this costs extra doses.

-----

### **3. Environmental Changes**

**Description:** As the numbed population grows, the game world reflects the descent into the void, creating a stark contrast between the beginning and end of the game.

**Mechanics:**

- **Visual Decay:**
  - The UI and background gradually lose color, fading from vibrant to grayscale as the numbed percentage increases.
  - Landmarks and cities crumble, overtaken by nature, with vines, dust, and decay dominating the visuals.
- **Soundscapes:**
  - The soundtrack becomes more distorted, with eerie silences replacing once-lively ambient noise.
  - Voices in the game (e.g., NPCs, announcements) grow quieter and more monotone, eventually fading entirely.
- **Resource Scarcity:**
  - As fewer people remain un-numbed, Emotional Essence becomes harder to harvest, forcing players to rely on recycling or riskier strategies.
  - Environmental hazards (e.g., collapsing infrastructure, natural disasters) increase, requiring essence to repair or mitigate.

-----

### **4. New Items and Upgrades**

**Description:** New items and upgrades expand the player’s toolkit, pushing the boundaries of how far they’re willing to go to achieve total numbness.

**Mechanics:**

- **Advanced Doses:**
  - **Multi-Numbing Doses:** Numb multiple people with a single dose, ideal for rapid expansion.
    - Cost: High essence and research investment.
    - Risk: Increases resistance due to aggressive numbing tactics.
  - **Fast-Acting Doses:** Skip directly to Stage 2 or 3 numbing, bypassing earlier stages.
    - Cost: Expensive and resource-intensive.
    - Risk: Accelerates environmental decay and resistance.
- **Numbing Machines:**
  - Automated devices that numb people without doses but require constant essence upkeep.
  - Benefit: Scales numbing efforts without manual input.
  - Drawback: Vulnerable to rebel attacks, and breakdowns increase as the numbed percentage grows.
- **Essence Extractors:**
  - Upgradeable machines that harvest essence more efficiently from the un-numbed population.
  - Benefit: Increases essence yield, delaying scarcity.
  - Drawback: Overuse can damage un-numbed individuals, reducing their long-term essence potential.
- **Void Amplifiers:**
  - Devices that amplify the numbing effect, increasing the range or speed of distribution.
  - Benefit: Rapidly expands numbed territory.
  - Drawback: High essence cost and increased resistance due to widespread numbing.

### **5. Darkest Concepts**

**Description:** These mechanics push the game’s darkness to its limits, forcing players to confront the moral and existential consequences of their actions.

**Mechanics:**

- **Self-Numbing:**
  - Players can choose to numb themselves temporarily for boosts (e.g., faster production, reduced resistance) but risk losing control over certain mechanics.
  - Effects:
    - Hallucinations distort the UI, making it harder to read or interact with.
    - Temporary loss of control over numbed individuals, as the player becomes detached.
  - Risk: Repeated self-numbing accelerates the player’s descent into numbness, leading to permanent effects (see below).
- **Numbing the Elite:**
  - Players can target influential figures (politicians, celebrities, scientists) to gain strategic advantages:
    - Reduce resistance by numbing key rebel leaders.
    - Increase essence harvest by numbing influential un-numbed individuals.
  - Risk: Sparks mass protests or rebel uprisings, as the public reacts to losing their leaders.
- **Numbing the Player:**
  - As the game progresses, the player’s own consciousness begins to numb, reflected in:
    - Sluggish controls or delayed inputs, simulating a loss of will.
    - Distorted visuals or text that becomes harder to read, mirroring intellectual numbing.
    - A final choice to “take the last dose” and end the game in total darkness, with the screen fading to black and the soundtrack silencing.
  - This mechanic ties directly to the lore, making the player’s descent into the void personal and immersive.
